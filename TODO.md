Todo for v 1.0:
* Options/pause screen
* Callboard on click better (expand?)
* Handle dynamic number of cards 
* Game over screen
* Pause time when app not in focus?
* All the css. So much css. Needs to be all dynamic/relative. Temporary absolute positioning is temporary.
* Background for screens


Game mode ideas:
* Game mode where every x numbers called, your rows get shuffled. :O
