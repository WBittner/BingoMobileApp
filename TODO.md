Todo for v 1.0:
* Options/pause screen
* Callboard on click better (expand? pause time?)
* Game over screen
* Back button handling? prmopt y/n + pause?
* Clean up game card spacing and size
* Background for screens
* bug: callboard doesn't update after resume from pause...

Game mode ideas:
* Game mode where every x numbers called, your rows get shuffled. :O
